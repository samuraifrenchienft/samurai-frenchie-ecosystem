## 3. Vesting Philosophy

The goal is to keep $CHIE'S as close to a **fair meme launch** as possible,
while still leaving room for growth, support, and strategic partners.

- Liquidity & Fair Launch allocation dominates the supply (83%).  
- Non-LP allocations unlock more slowly or under clear, announced conditions.  

**Example vesting approach:**

- **Community & Promotion:**  
  - Partial unlock at launch for initial campaigns  
  - Remaining tokens streamed over **6–12 months**

- **Team & Ops:**  
  - Long vesting with a **6–12 month cliff**  
  - Linear vesting over **12–24 months** after the cliff  

- **Future Investors & Advisors:**  
  - Short degen-style vesting (for example, **35–50% at TGE** and the rest unlocked over **1–3 months**)  
  - Only used if strategic deals make sense for the project

## 4. Launch & Liquidity Plan (Summary)

- Launch on a Solana DEX (e.g., Raydium / Jupiter routing)  
- Majority of supply added to liquidity at launch  
- LP to be **locked or burned** to build trust  
- No taxes, no confusing mechanics — just trading, memes, and community
